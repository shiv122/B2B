<h3><strong>Warehouse Returns Policy for Sellers</strong></h3>
 This Warehouse Returns Policy (" <strong>Policy</strong>") shall be applicable to the sellers (hereinafter referred to as " <strong>you</strong>" / " <strong>Seller</strong>") that are availing warehousing services from Hiveloop Logistics Private Limited (" <strong>HLPL</strong>"), for storage for your non-food products in the warehouses of HLPL. This Policy shall be applicable to any of the following cases; 
<ol>
<li>return request(s) has been raised by the Buyer(s);</li>
<li>undelivered shipment(s);</li>
<li>any other returns as agreed under the warehousing service agreement executed between You
and HLPL (i.e., product(s) re-called by the Seller(s), and/or product(s) returned by HLPL, for
any reason whatsoever).</li>
</ol>
 Any capitalised terms used herein this Policy and not defined explicitly shall have the same meaning as defined in the warehousing service agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Policy and the terms of the warehousing services agreement entered into between you and HLPL, the provisions as set out in this Policy shall prevail and supersede. 
<h4><strong>1. In case of any return request raised by the Buyer and /or any undelivered shipments:</strong></h4>

<ol>
<li>wrong Product(s) and/or damaged Product(s);</li>
<li>missing product(s); and /or</li>
<li>difference in quantity,</li>
</ol>
 then HLPL will facilitate the return of such Product(s) to the designated warehouse location of HLPL (from where the Product(s) was dispatched). 
 Once the Product(s) is received at the designated warehouse location of HLPL, the Product(s) would be checked by HLPL for any outer damage and/or any visible tampering to the packaging and/or any material damages to the Product(s). If the Product(s) is found to be without any such damages, the Product(s) would be accepted and inventoried in the warehouse by HLPL. However, if the product(s) is found to be damaged, and/or tampered with, for reasons attributable to us, the Product(s) will be retained by HLPL and the order value of such tampered or damaged Product will be reimbursed to you. In this regard, our decision with respect to the findings in relation to the damage / tampering of the Product(s) and the order value to be reimbursed to you shall be final and binding on you.

In the event, the Product(s) is found to be damaged due to the above-mentioned reasons, such Product(s) will be retained by HLPL and the order value/ cost of such tampered or damaged Product will be reimbursed to you. In this regard, our decision shall be final and binding on you. You shall be obligated to accept such Products.
